New York Taxi Demand Prediction 🚕📈

This project builds a machine learning model to predict hourly demand for yellow taxis in New York City using historical trip data. It aims to optimize taxi fleet distribution and enhance the passenger experience.

🚀 Objective
	•	Predict taxi demand across different NYC regions at 10-minute intervals.
	•	Support dispatch systems, dynamic pricing, and urban traffic management.
	•	Deploy a scalable, retrainable ML model ready for production (MLOps).

📚 Dataset
	•	Source: NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data
	•	Data Range: January 2016 – March 2016
	•	Records: 35.5 million+
	•	Features: Pickup/dropoff time and location, trip distance, fare amount, passenger count, etc.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
	•	Languages: Python
	•	Libraries: Polars, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
	•	Version Control: GitHub
	•	Notebook Environment: Jupyter Notebooks

🧹 Data Preprocessing
	•	Outlier removal: Based on NYC bounding box (latitude and longitude).
	•	Feature engineering: Trip time, trip distance, speed calculation.
	•	Unix time binning: 10-minute interval aggregation.
	•	Clustering: MiniBatchKMeans clustering on pickup locations.

🧠 Feature Engineering
	•	Lag features (previous 5 time intervals of pickups)
	•	Cluster latitude, longitude, ID
	•	Weekday encoding
	•	Exponential moving averages
	•	Timestamp-based features (10-minute bins)

📈 Modeling Approach
	•	Input Features: ft_1, ft_2, ft_3, ft_4, ft_5, latitude, longitude, weekday, exp_avg, cluster_id
	•	Target Variable: Number of pickups per cluster per 10-minute interval
	•	Model: Supervised Learning Models (RandomForestRegressor used)

📊 Evaluation Metrics
	•	Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
	•	Mean Squared Error (MSE)

🌐 Deployment (Planned only Flask)
	•	Flask app.py and index.html
